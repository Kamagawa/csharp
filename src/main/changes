Several changes were made to this code since the demo day. Most of them involve the revision of comments in terms of grammar and format. Single-line comments were added throughout the code in order to better explain the program. Also, inconsistencies in syntax, formatting, and indentation were fixed. There were a few modifications outside of comments and formatting. Specifically, the parameter |dir| in |moveTrayToPosition()| was changed to |travel| to better adhere to standard naming conventions. A number of do-while loops were removed from task |sharpenAndSort()| because the conditions for repetition were never met. Also, the definitions of the unused constants |FAIL_TIMEOUT| and |ENC_TOL| were removed. Finally, an #endif directive was relocated to the end of the utils.c file.

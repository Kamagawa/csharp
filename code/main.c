* <h1>Main.C</h1>
* <p>The main.c file is the component of the Csharp program.
* It contains the task main, which is where the programme
* will be called by LEGO NXT robot. </p>
*
* <p> The function aims to stucture the overall organization of the
* robot. the main.c calls the following files and
* contains these variables, and functions: </p>
*
* <p><b>Includes: </b>"action.c", "controls.c", "util.c", "ports.c"</p>

* <b>constant variables:</b>
* const int BATTERY_THRESHOLD = 9000;

* </p>
*
* <p>
* <b>Funcions</b>
* monitorTray()
* sharpenAndSort()
* task main()
* </p>
*
* <b>Note:</b> The program will only work when all the specified files,
* function, and variable are present in the package
